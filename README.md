bees, flies, and wasps were collected from 32 sites (all_sites_2020.csv) located in the greater Vancouver, BC, area. These collections were conducted once in July and once in August, using coloured pan traps placed for 24 hour periods. Insect community data is currently in progress and will be re-uploaded when all species identities have been assigned.

Counts of floral unit abundance and species richness at sites were also obtained at each site visit (floral_abundances.csv).

Preliminary work has been done in R (floral_abundance_and_land_v_insects.R) to reshape data structure and to compare floral abundances by site and date. Additionally, the script contains preliminary analysis to determine the effect of park management type and month on overall abundance of bees, syrphid flies, and wasps, as well as the relationship between bee abundance and floral resource density in the park.
