Repository for data and analysis files backup corresponding to field work from summer 2020.

bees, flies, and wasps were collected from 32 sites (all_sites_2020.csv) located in the greater Vancouver, BC, area. These collections were conducted once in July and once in August, using coloured pan traps placed for 24 hour periods. Insect community data has not yet been processed and uploaded. 

Counts of floral unit abundance and species richness at sites were also obtained at each site visit (floral_abundances.csv).

Preliminary work has been done in R (floral_abundance_and_land_v_insects.R) to reshape data structure and to compare floral abundances by site and date.
